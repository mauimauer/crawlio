crawlio
=======

This little bugger crawls YouTube videos for Google I/O Invites.
Wrote it on 04/22/2014 so there is little chance it'll actually find a valid redeem link.

What does it do?
----------------

* Lists all the Videos on Google-related YouTube channels
* Gets the annotations contained in those videos
* Checks if the Shortlink has been found (ie. clicked) by others already
